SONG TITLE' Don't Cry
TODAY I found' MY BEST FRIEND'
HE IS A unique individual '
I COME GITHUB BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND HIM'
BUT I KNOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN CLEANED FOR WHEN HE COMES BACK'
I MISS HIM'

Talk to me softly'
There's something in your eyes'
Don't hang your head in sorrow'
And please don't cry'
I know how you feel inside, now 
I've been there before'
Somethin's changing inside you'
And don't you know '
Don't you cry tonight '
I still love you baby '
Don't you cry tonight ' And
Don't you cry tonight '
There's a heaven above you baby '
And don't you cry tonight '
Give me a whisper ' and please give me a sign '
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye '
Don't take it so hard now' and please don't take it so bad'
I'll still be thinking of you'
And the times we had'-baby'
And don't you cry tonight ' 
Don't you cry tonight '
Don't you cry tonight '
There's a heaven above you baby ' 
And don't you cry tonight, ' 
And please remember '

And please remember '
How I felt inside now, honey '
You gotta make it your own way '
But your be alright now sugar '
You feel better tomorrow '
Come the morning light now baby

And don't you cry tonight ' 
And don't you cry tonight ' 
And don't you cry tonight '
There's a heaven above you baby '
And don't you cry '
